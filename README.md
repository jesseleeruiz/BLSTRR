## Background 😃
My nephew has been asking me again and again for a game on the iPhone he can play. This is my first, and simple, attempt at doing that. I started going through [Paul Hudson's _Advanced iOS: Volume Two_](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/advanced-ios-2) and have been learning so much! Here is some of the fruit from this deep dive.
